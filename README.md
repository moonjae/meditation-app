# meditation-app
Front-end centric iOS meditation app implemented in Objective - C

This app plays a guided meditation audio file for the amount of time designated in the pickerview. 
Heatbeat like animation is implemented using CALayer, CaBasicAnimation and blurred imageview is implemented through GPUImage library's blur filter.

* Please bear in mind that this is just a GIF image that consists of three frames. The animation is smoother when run on the actual app

3. blurred imageView with opacity of 0.4  ``` thirdView ```
